You may have to convert from one unit to another. Being farmilar with measuring equivalents will help you adjust the yield of a recipe. For instance, 3 teaspoon is the equivalent to of 1 tablespoon. Suppose you are doubling a recipe that calls for 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Two times 1 1/2 teaspoons equals 3 teaspoons, or 1 tablespoon. Likewise, 1/4 cups equals 4 tablespoons. Suppose you're having a recipe that calls for 1/4 cup sugar. You can easily figure that half of 4 tablespoons is 2 tablespoons.  ",
