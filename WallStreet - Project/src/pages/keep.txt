                            <p className="about-text abt">Fast-forward a million years or so to a more civilized world. In 1644, the Dutch West India Company in New Amsterdam (latter named New York City) decided too many cows wandered around in the island of Manhattan. The company decided, "Resolved, that a fence shall be made, and all area to repair thither on Monday, 4th April, with tools to build a fence." The resulting barricade was an earthen embankment, studded with uprooted tree trunks, at the southern tip of Manhattan.
                                A few years later, in 1653, Governor Peter Stuyvesant knew that the British were about to attack and guess they would arrive by land. He ordered local residents, mostly soldiers and Dutch colonists, to raise the fence and dig a moat the length of it.
                                But Stuyvesant missed the boat. The British didn't attack by land. They came by sea in 1664, anchored off Cony Island, and captured the settlement without firing a shot. Later, they burned the wall. The street that run  alongside survived, though, and retained its name--Wall Street.
                                The New York Stock Exchange was born in New York City, when the first Congress met in Federal Hall in 1789 to assume the debts of the new colonies and government. The Congress issued about $80 million in government notes, creating an exciting new market in

                                To participate in this market, many investors helped fund American companies by buying shares of ownership. The investors had eqity and could prove so by the certificates of stock issued by the company,  in exchange for the equity capital given by the investors. That stock provide the investor's participation, and so secured the debt. That's why shares of stock are alternately called <i>stocks, equities</i>, and <i>securities.</i>
                                In 1827, a new Merchants Exchanged building, erected at Wall and Honover streets, housed the New York Stock and Exchange Board. By 1842, the American Stock Exchange open its doors. Both exchanges enforced strict rules governing the sale of stocks, and Wall Street began its evolution as one of the world's most important financial centers.</p>

                The PPI is an important report, but it doesn't usually cause market moves as big as those effected by the CPI and the employment report.
The PPi measures prices at the producer level. In other words, it's the measurement of raw materials to companies that produce goods. The markets is interested in two things contained in this report:
1) How fast these prices are rising: If a rise in PPI is significantly lkarge in comparison to previous months, the market to see where it's coming from.
For example, the May 2005 PPI report pegged prices at the producer level as rising 0.6 percent in April, following a 0.7 percent increase in March and a 0.4 percent hike in February. At first glance, the market view the April increase (compared to the previous two months) as a negative number. Howere, market makers discovered a note deeper in the report, indicating that you don't measure food and energy--in this case (especially) oil prices--producer prices at the so-called core level rose only 0.3 percent.
2) Whether the producers are passing along any price hikes to their consumers: If prices at the core level are tame, as they seems to be in the April 2005 report, traders will conduct business based on the information they have in hand, at least until the CPI is released--usually one or two days after the PPI is released. In this case, based only on the PPI, inflation at the core producer level was tame, so traders wagered that producers were not passing any added costs on to the consumer.
